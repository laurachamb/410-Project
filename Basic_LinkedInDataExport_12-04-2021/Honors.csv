Livingston Fellowship - Finalist,"The Livingston Fellowship Program provides advanced learning opportunities to promising nonprofit leaders who hold significant leadership roles in Colorado’s nonprofit sector. This innovative professional development program reflects our belief that no investment in the tangible assets of a nonprofit organization can equal an investment in its greatest asset—its leaders.  The Program is named in honor of Johnston R. Livingston, a long-time Trustee, Chairman and later Chairman Emeritus of the Foundation. John passed away in September 2008, but his passion for innovation, entrepreneurism, and creativity continues to inspire each class of Livingston Fellows.  Fellows are selected on the basis of exceptional leadership ability, promise for significant and unique contributions to the nonprofit sector, and the potential for the Fellowship experience to enable them to move from “success to significance” as leaders of people, organizations and the nonprofit sector.",May 2016
