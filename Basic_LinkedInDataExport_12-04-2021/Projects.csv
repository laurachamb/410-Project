A Market Evaluation of Colorado's High Performance Buildings,"Colorado’s real estate industry leaders remain skeptical about the financial benefits of high performance commercial buildings.  A survey and index were developed to understand the industry’s perspectives on public policies, programs, and market mechanisms. Additionally, a secondary data analysis was conducted to determine if these buildings command financial benefits for the industry. While national studies reveal financial benefits, results of this data analysis are parallel with the survey and index reflecting the industry's perspective; financial benefits for high performance commercial buildings in Colorado is unverifiable at this time, primarily due to limited data sets from existing programs and industry databases.  Policy recommendations to improve data availability are included.",http://www.costar.com/uploadedFiles/JOSRE/JournalPdfs/05_123-148-J4_A_Market_Evaluation_of_Colorados_High_Performance_Commercial_Buildings.pdf,2011,2012
CO Impact Days and Initiative,"The Colorado Impact Initiative is a 3-year strategy designed to elevate and accelerate impact investing in Colorado, specifically to catalyze the flow of $100 million in investment capital into Colorado-based ventures that deliver positive impact on the state’s communities, economy and natural environment.   The flagship event, Colorado Impact Day, March 3-4, 2016 in Denver, Colorado, is the first multi-track competition devoted entirely to assessing and expanding the impact investment opportunities in for-profit and nonprofit ventures in Colorado. It is intended to engage new impact investors and philanthropists and to drive new capital into the local market by generating knowledge and facilitating connections between investors and investees. While Colorado Impact Day will be designed as a business competition (e.g. pitches, awards, prizes, etc.), its enduring value is threefold and cooperative:   1.	In assessing the impact investing landscape – both supply and demand of capital; 2.	In connecting worthy ventures to the time, treasure, and talent they need; and 3.	In educating and advancing the impact investing marketplace ",http://www.coloradoimpactday.org,Nov 2014,
National Foundation Philanthropy and Investing Research Project,"While foundations have a singular mission, the staff and trustees have different skills, experiences, and job objectives as they relate achieving that mission. The National Foundation Philanthropy & Investment Research project is designed to understand the similarities and differences in how these professionals make informed decisions about philanthropic and investment opportunities.  This project will bolster the current collective knowledge of philanthropy and investing by understanding:  How investment officers trade off impact, financial return, risk and liquidity; How program officers trade off impact, financial return, risk and liquidity; and How differences and similarities in the tradeoffs made by various professionals correlate to the singular mission of the foundation.  Methods: The overarching methodology for the Research Project is conjoint analysis, a statistical technique used in market research to determine how people value different attributes of a product or service. The National Foundation Philanthropy and Investment Research Project deploys three specific conjoint methods: Discrete Choice, Maximum Difference Scaling and Intended Behavior. Between these three methods, the Research Project is expected to produce a robust set of data on how investment and philanthropic decisions are made. Foundations are being selected at random to participate in this project-- the first national peer-reviewed research study of its kind.",http://www.impactfinancecenter.org/impact-investing-research-project/,Jan 2015,
