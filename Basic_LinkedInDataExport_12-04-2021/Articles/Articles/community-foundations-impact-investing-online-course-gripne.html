Founded in 2012, IFC has a goal to catalyze $1T in investment capital toward solving a diverse range of environmental and social challenges. In 2015, in partnership with a founding community steering committee, IFC launched CO Impact Days &amp; Initiative, the first-ever statewide marketplace for impact investing to catalyze $100M of investments into social ventures (i.e., projects, nonprofits, startups, for-profits, and funds). Since then, CO Impact Days has ignited a movement of previously untapped capital into Colorado's social ventures (i.e., projects, nonprofits, for-profits, and funds). The Initiative has included 120 presentations and courses throughout the state year around that culminated in two CO Impact Days, a three-day investor experiential learning conference. Initial estimates suggest that over 200 direct investments have been made. </p> 
  <p>Thank you for the opportunity to better inform you about <a href="http://www.impactfinancecenter.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Impact Finance Center </strong></a>(IFC)<strong>, </strong><a href="http://www.coimpactdays.org/" target="_blank"><strong>CO Impact Days Initiative</strong></a><strong>, </strong>and our plans to scale, replicate, and create the <strong>National Impact Investing Marketplace</strong>. Just as Accelerators such as Techstars, Village Capital, or 500 Startups identify, educate, and invest in entrepreneurs, <em>IFC is an Accelerator for the asset owners, where we</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>identify, educate, and activate early adopter philanthropists and investors who want to become impact investors</em>. IFC was founded in 2012 and is a nonprofit academic center that forms partnerships with academic institutions. IFC realized early on that there was little investor education available to asset owners that did not involve a conflict of interest. Hence, IFC's goal is to provide high-quality investor education and technical assistance for asset owners through their trusted membership organizations, such as community foundations or investor groups, to ensure that their philanthropy, which is an investment of -100% financial return, is more efficient and their investments have more effective impact.<a href="http://file:///C:/Users/steph/Downloads/EDITED%20Impact%20Finance%20Center%20is%20a%20multi-university%20nonprofit%20academic%20center%20that%20identifies,%20trains,%20and%20activates%20philanthropists%20and%20investors%20to%20become%20impact%20investors.edited.docx#_msocom_17" target="_blank">[G17]</a>&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>IFC’s flagship initiative, CO Impact Days and Initiative, is the first-ever statewide marketplace for impact investing and Phase 1 of the National Impact Investing Marketplace. IFC has completed over 100 education events as part of CO Impact Initiative, and CO Impact Days 2016 and 2017 together showcased more than 150 social ventures, connecting them to mentors, partners, and impact investment capital.<strong> </strong>We are embarking on a formal evaluation of direct, indirect, and community successes from 2015-17. Early estimates indicate that 75+ Foundation direct impact investments and 150+ individual direct impact investments have been catalyzed by IFC’s work, in addition to upgrading the governance of several asset owners.</p> 
  <p><strong>How do we create the National Impact Investing Marketplace?</strong> We do it by scaling CO Impact Days and Initiative to a regional Rocky Mountain Impact Days and Initiative while replicating it throughout the U.S to develop six regional marketplaces. </p> 
  <p>We have all the pieces of the puzzle on the table. Now we need to commercialize and scale the solution.</p> 
  <p>Our <strong>goal </strong>is to create the National Impact Investing Marketplace by 2030.</p> 
  <p>Our strategy is simple.</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to <strong><em>grow more impact investors</em></strong> faster and more efficiently</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We create a <strong><em>self-sustaining financial mode</em>l</strong> for Impact Days and Initiative.</p> 
  <p>The three tactics will use to achieve that will be</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formalizing our education and launching <strong>Impact Investing Education Institute</strong></p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launch <strong>Impact Investing Giving Circles</strong> that will recruit new philanthropists and investors</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop a social enterprise model for <strong>Impact Days and Initiative</strong> that will result in a financially self-sustaining social enterprise.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Impact Investing Education Institute</strong> starting with converting in-person courses to online testing whether or not we can effectively charge for education. If the online courses are effective in&nbsp;<em>identifying</em> new philanthropists and investors and <em>educating</em> while producing a sliding scale modest revenue. The following quote illustrates the value of this education to investors.</p> 
  <p><em>"It's super rare to get world-class portfolio advice from someone who doesn't have their hand in your pocket. It's rarer to get a whole new framework for thinking about donations and philanthropic work. Rarest is all is a combination of clear next steps and challenge to take action. Stephanie Gripne and John O'Halloran of the Impact Finance Center deliver a trifecta." </em>&nbsp;<strong><em>Jon Kauffman</em></strong></p> 
  <p><em>"I've been in the field of aligning money with values and business, since the early 80's. I wrote a book about it and do many interviews and talks on the topic. Watching Stephanie map an overview of the diverse strategies and creative possibilities for moving money towards positive impact, was by far the best, most action-packed, cogent, eye-opening presentation and overview of the field that I have ever experienced. Talk to Stephanie. Book her to speak to your group. Encourage her to write a book, do video training, or clone herself. You will be doing a great service for the world. Her presentation of the comprehensive strategies available to influence and leverage capital for the betterment of communities and issues, will give rich dividends. Put on your seatbelt!" </em><strong><em>Joel Solomon</em></strong><em>, Chair-Renewal Funds</em>, <em>Author-"The Clean Money Revolution"</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Impact Investing Giving Circles</strong> will physically grow new impact investors through a process of identifying, educating, and activating them through experiential group learning at the cost of $500-$5,000 assuming we can raise philanthropic support to cover the administration and education costs of running the circles in partnership with the community foundations. For example, Yampa Valley Community Foundation has identified 40-50 philanthropists and investors who are going to be approached to donating $10,000-25,000 into a Northwest Colorado Impact Investing Giving Circle for ($250,000-$500,000) into a pooled “Special Purpose Fund.”</p> 
  <p>Below are the Impact Investing Giving Circles that IFC is currently working on:</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women: Denver/Colorado in partnership with the Commons of Champa’s Women’s Executive Council</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northwest Colorado Rural Community Development: Steamboat Springs/Colorado and Yampa Valley Community Foundation</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainability: Denver/Colorado in partnership with Andrew C. Currie and Ryan Martens</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food: Denver/Colorado in partnership with Basta Chef Kelly Whitaker</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veterans: Denver/Colorado in partnership with the Commons of Champa</p> 
  <p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outdoor &amp; Natural Foods in partnership with Alissa Sears</p> 
  <p>You can read how it fits into our national vision that was published in the Foundation Review this past year ”<a href="https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/e5842425-4b96-4dd9-8939-9c788f66104b/scholarworks-gvsu-edu-tfr-vol8-iss5-8" target="_blank">Laying the Groundwork of the National Impact Investing Marketplace</a>,” which builds off of the <a href="https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/e5842425-4b96-4dd9-8939-9c788f66104b/forbes-com-sites-devinthorpe-2016-06-22-is-this-wildlife-conservation-phd-the-steve-jobs-of-impact-investing" target="_blank">Forbes</a> article.</p>
