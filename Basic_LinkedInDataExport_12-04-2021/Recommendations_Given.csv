Andrea ,Learned ðŸš² â“‹,"Learned On, LLC",Founder/Chief Strategist,"From the first week we worked with Andrea, it was obvious she knew how to identify conversations and influencers that would be important to our impact investing and foundation audiences. She has an uncanny ability to catch onto the flow of a discussion, to see the important events or chats for us to join, and to spy ways weâ€™d otherwise never have noticed to reach an ever broader range of stakeholders.     Because our organization is passionately purpose-driven, we werenâ€™t sure if Andrea could dive right in without guidance.  But, that was not an issue at all. She understands how to craft a tweet and knows which voice and style will add most value and build community. Until we worked with Andrea, we had no idea about the opportunities in using Twitter, especially, for building our leadership presence.  We are beyond sold on her expertise.  ","10/27/16, 04:47 PM",
