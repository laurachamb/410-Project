"Using Venture Philanthropy Tools, Program Related Investments, to Fund Building Retrofits",Jan 2013,"The paper focuses on new sources of capital for building retrofits, specifically program related  investments. We outline the problems that arise from  dependency on importing fossil fuels; explain the  mechanics of retrofits; and explore how a specific  impact investing tool—program related investments— can be used to finance building improvements and  retrofits. Ultimately, retrofitting the built environment  through energy efficiency projects improves national  security, creates American jobs, reduces energy bills,  lowers emissions, decreases infrastructure costs, and  improves air quality",Conservation Leadership Council,http://www.leadingwithconservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/CLC_IV-Gripne_Last_1.3.13.pdf
A Market Evaluation of Colorado's High Performance Buildings,"Jun 1, 2012","State industry leaders remain skeptical about the business case for high performance commercial buildings.  To compare these buildings with conventional buildings, Colorado CoStar, LEED®, and ENERGY STAR® data were analyzed to evaluate financial outcomes, and a survey and index were developed to assess leaders’ views of supply/demand, barriers, and incentives.  Results indicate a modest rent premium for LEED and ENERGY STAR buildings, and that price and operating costs are the top factors influencing decision making. The evaluation of state-level business cases is challenging due to the lack of available performance data, the trend to not seek certification, and small sample sizes.
